This file will specify the working of the TCP Client Server

The main execution of both the programs occurs in the main function.
The name of the file containing client code is recommandclient.c .
The name of the file containing server code is recommandserver.c .

The server code has 3 functions apart from MAIN - 
parsingfunction() - This function is used to break the linux command arguments and store them into an array so that they can be passed to execvp.
coinToss() - This function generated 0 or 1 randomly (0 depicts heads and 1 depicts tails)
isValidIP() - This function determines whether the IP is valid (that is belonging to HAAS or LWSN labs). For valid IPs, it returns true, otherwise it returns false

The main() function has the main logic for the code.
The server will toss a coin before reading the first message from the client. If heads is obtained, server will not read client's messages.
Server will start reading client's messages only in case of Tails result of a coin toss.
After coin toss, server checks client's IP. For correct IP, (belonging to HAAS or LWSN), the server starts reading the messages. 
For an incorrect IP, server will terminate client socket.
In a time, server will only take requests from atmost 5 clients.'

The code can be run as follows:
1. Run the makefile to compile the server file. 'recommandserver.bin' and 'recommandclient.bin' files will be generated after executing make file.
2. Run the server by giving the following in command prompt/terminal:
./recommandserver.bin Server_IP Server_Port

As an example -
./recommandserver.bin 128.10.25.213 55564

2. Run the client by giving the following in command prompt/terminal:
./recommandclient.bin Server_IP Server_Port

As an example -
./recommandclient.bin 128.10.25.213 55564
