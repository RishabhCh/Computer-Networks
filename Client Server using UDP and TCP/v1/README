The solution consists of 3 files:
mypingsrv.c // Server
mypingcli.c // Client
pingparam.dat // To provide parameters

Populating the pingparam file -
pingparam file will have the values
N T D S
where N,T,D,S are symbols according to the question. 
By default, the values provided while submitting the solution are:
N = 5, T = 1, D = 2, S = 1234
So, for instance, 2 messages are to be sent with 2 second time delay at the client and 1 second time delay at the server with the message 1357, then the 
Pingparam file will look like:
2 2 1 1357

Please note, program is written in a way that the value for S should be a 4 digit integer(1000 to 9990), (resembling 4-byte payload). 
Any other value will result in incorrect execution.

The client will send the 4-digit message value in the pingparam file for N (symbol according to the question) times., each time, the 
number that is sent will be incremented by 1.
The server will receive the message concatenated with the D delay seconds and will act accordingly.

The code can be run as follows:
1. Run the makefile to compile the client and server files. 'mypingsrv.bin' and 'mypingcli.bin' files will be generated after executing make file.
2. Run the server by giving the following in command prompt/terminal:
./mypingsrv.bin Server_IP Server_Port

As an example -
./mypingsrv.bin.bin 128.10.25.213 55564

2. Run the client by giving the following in command prompt/terminal:
./recommandclient.bin Client_IP Server_IP Server_Port

As an example -
./mypingcli.bin 128.10.112.135 128.10.25.213 55564
