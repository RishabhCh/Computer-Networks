Ping times obtained from the program

LWSN to LWSN ~ 0.222 milliseconds
LWSN to HAAS ~ 0.640 milliseconds

Ping times obtained from /bin/ping

LWSN to LWSN ~ 0.145 milliseconds
LWSN to HAAS ~ 0.260 milliseconds

Interpretation of this
Due to distance, LWSN to LWSN pings are much shorter as they are in the same building.

Ping command is much faster than the ping implemented in the solution (Datagram (UPD) sockets). 
This means that whichever protocol ping command is using, it is faster than UPD protocol.
