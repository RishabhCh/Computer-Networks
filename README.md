# Computer-Networks
This repository contains programs related to building applications related to computer networks. 
These are solutions to the assignments for the graduate computer networks course I took under professor Kihong Park (http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/) at Purdue University.
Although they are solutions to assignments, they do contain implementations of some interesting applications of computer networks.
The codes are written in C language and display concepts that can be used for computer networks and system programming.

Each folder in the repository contains the problem statement and subfolders that have solution to each question in the problem statement.
