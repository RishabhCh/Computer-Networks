This README file is for Question 2 of the lab assignment.
There are 2 executables commandserver.bin and commandclient.bin for the server and client respectively.
The name of the server FIFO is serverfifo and will be stored in the serverfifo.dat file
Client will read the name of the server FIFO from this file and write the user input in this FIFO.
A server and multiple clients can be opened. All the user requests from the client will be executed using the server and will be displayed in the server stdout.
