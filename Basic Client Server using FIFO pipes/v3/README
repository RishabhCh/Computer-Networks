This is the directory for the solution of Question 3.
After executing the makefile, 
The name of the server executable will be - commandserver.bin
The name of the client executable will be - commandclient.bin
On opening the client for each time, a client FIFO will be made.
For the server, only one FIFO - serverfifo will be made. The name for this will be stored in serverfifo.dat file after the server is executed.
After opening a server and multiple client executables, the output of any command in the client will be displayed in the client window itself.
The string parsing function has been changed for this question. A delimiter is added so that the function is flexible for splitting strings separated by any delimiter.
